### <a name="git-entry">Git Recap</a>
I activelly use git for not a long time and course from Udacity helped me a lot to figure out the things which were not very clear to me. For example, I've had troubles with merging and resolving conflicts. Also it was not clear for me, how git can manage different branches and commits.

The main new points that I learned from this course.
 - Flags for `git log`:
 ```
    $ git log --oneline
    $ git log --stat
 ```
 - Command for working with branches `git branch` + commands to create, delete or switch the branch.
 - Command for merging and ways for resolving conflicts.
 - I didn't know that after reset the data is stored in 30 days.
